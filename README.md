# Factory Automation with ROS

This project is structured into several key components, which together create a cohesive system for automating factory task:

- ROS Pub-Sub Architecture: Implementation of ROS's publish-subscribe communication model for inter-node messaging.
- Gazebo Simulation and URDF: Simulating the environment using Gazebo and defining the robot's structure with URDF files.
- ROS Mapping: Utilizing ROS‚Äôs mapping packages for spatial awareness and environmental mapping.
- Navigation System: Creating autonomous navigation with ROS‚Äôs navigation stack.
- Robotic Manipulation with MoveIt: Enabling precise manipulation and motion planning using the MoveIt package.
- Comprehensive Factory Automation: Integrating all components and orchestrating the flow using FlexBE for the final automation.
